Songdir is a web service to manage songs and lists, allowing to upload lyrics, lyrics+chords, sheets or images per song.

## Installation

Install crystal compiler in your system. Also install shards which is the package manager.

## Usage

Once the crystal package was installed successfully, then run:

```bash
$ cd songdir_service
$ crystal src/application.cr
```

## Development

## Input
This project represents the knowledge aquired during almost four years of my life. That experience is about Ruby and Python.
After using Django and Ruby on Rails I decided to build my own API library, which is more simple and doesn't impose an architecture.

## Output
The web service itself is an useful service and a candidate to develop a set of functions and classes which gives the library mentioned above.
The library modules are located in src/lib and they must be easily separable.
